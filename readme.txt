== Description ==
Simple IPv6 detector widget for WordPress to show if user is connecting with IPv6 or IPv4.

Additionaly, it makes a link to a whois service with the ip address.

It was born because of my own blog. I needed to include a little box that shows users ip and different messages depending on the ip version.

The idea behind this is to promote and leave a way to discover and make sense about the ipv4 address space limits.
